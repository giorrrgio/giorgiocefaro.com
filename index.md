# I help engineering teams deliver software.

I work with developers to grow their skillset through continuous challenges and feedback and optimize their performance with a data-driven approach.

I practice agile and continuous improvement. I love DDD.

I have a very broad experience with stacks and languages. I embrace the DevOps culture.

I am patient, calm, rational, inclusive and always well-disposed to recognize and remove any bias (I wanted to say bias-free, but life is not that easy, you know).
