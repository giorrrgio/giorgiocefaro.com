# I help engineering teams deliver software.

I work with developers to grow their skills through continuous challenges and feedback and optimize their performance with a data-driven approach. I practice agile and continuous improvement. 

I have a very broad experience with stacks and languages. I embrace the DevOps culture. 

I describe my leadership style as  patient, calm, rational and inclusive, always looking to recognize and remove any bias.

I have been working  in the Software Engineering field for 20+ years.
